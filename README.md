In this project, I have shown you how to make your own Smart Home control device using ESP32 with Wear OS. Wear OS (also known simply as Wear and formerly Android Wear) is a version of Google's Android operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearables. By pairing with mobile phones running Android version 6.0 "Marshmallow" or newer, or iOS version 10.0 or newer with limited support from Google's pairing application, Wear OS integrates Google Assistant[12] technology and mobile notifications into a smartwatch form factor. Wear OS supports Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, 3G, and LTE connectivity, as well as a range of features and applications. Watch face styles include round, square and rectangular.

Beetle ESP32-C3, mainly intended for IoT applications, is a controller based on ESP32-C3 RISC-V 32bit single-core processor.

On a coin-size board of 25*_20.5 mm, there are up to 13 IO ports broken out, so you don't have to worry about running out of IO ports when making projects. Meanwhile, the li-ion battery charging management function is integrated on the board which allows for directly connecting the li-ion battery without extra modules, while ensuring the application size and safety.

The equipped expansion board for Beetle ESP32-C3 brings out more power sources without increasing product volume, more convenient for solder. Besides, the onboard easy-to-connect GDI saves the trouble of wiring when using a screen.

Beetle ESP32-C3 supports WiFi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) dual-mode communication that reduces the difficulty of networking, and also both Bluetooth Mesh protocol and Espressif WiFi Mesh are supported for more stable communication and a larger coverage area. Beetle ESP32-C3 can be programmed by Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, MicroPython, C, and Python are both supported.
